# melodyGPT
A GPT based model that is trained with song chords text.

## Dataset
The initial dataset is created by aggregating the chords of each song given by the [Chords and Lyrics Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eitanbentora/chords-and-lyrics-dataset). 
You can see in the dataset folder notebooks with the code used to do so.
Also, the special characters that are not chords are analysed.
For the simplicity of this project, we will start with the dataset without any processing.
